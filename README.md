- 👀 I’m interested in Windows programming with CA-Realizer, CA-dbFast, Free Basic, Code::Blocks, Borland C++, Visual C++, Visual Basic, Visual C#, Fortran Power Station, Open Cobol, Open Watcom C++, NetBeans, Delphi and Lazarus. OK, there is also a little OS/2 and Linux programming. I code freeware and I want to share it with others. Check the releases in my repositories.
